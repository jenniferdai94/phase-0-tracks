#How to use an elevator
When someone is in the elevator, it is going up or down. 
a.       It will go up and stop at every floor where either: 1) someone in the elevator has selected, or 2) someone outside the elevator has pressed the up button
b.      It will go down and stop at every floor where: 1) someone in the elevator has selected, or 2) someone outside the elevator has pressed the button
2    It will always stop at the bottom floor when going down if someone has pressed the up button
3    It will always stop at the top floor when going up if someone has pressed the down button

And, assuming we have an office building:
     The elevator will wait at the bottom floor when not in use between 7am-10am.
     The elevator will wait at the top floor when not in use between 3pm â€“ 7pm.
     At other times, the elevator will wait in the middle floor
